# Preserving Line Of Sight While Panning Robotic and Computer Vision Problem
This is a MATLAB project for my Computer Science 4610 Robotic Science and Systems class taken in Spring 2019. I did this project with Matthew Piorko.

This project is an exploration of using computer vision and various robot planning algorithms to preserve line of sight while panning with a robot. Specifically this project used a virtual robotic arm that had a virtual camera on it and used computer vision to identify a target and used pathing algorithms to pan the robotic arm while still keeping line of sight on the target. Further details can be found in the project report. Code can be found in src.
